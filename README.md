_I have been intrested in web technologies since 2009 and run several web projects on Wordpress, Ning, and even a podcast. Ive dabbled in HTML, CSS and Javascript, but I am finally getting deep into Python and really enjouying exploring all of what Python can do while I try to decide what my next steps will be. I'd love to hear feedback on my code and am also intrested in helping others with their peojects. In addition to technology I have a strong background in sales, marketing, and business development.
